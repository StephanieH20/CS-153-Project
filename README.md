# CS-153-Project
Spying on grasshoppers

Project contents are inside folder locust. locust_.py is the script that generates the augmented video along with detected orientation data for the sample videos (I had some trouble with data handling with the other videos). 

After the script runs, a window should appear of the error over time. The script also prints out the net orientation and net axis errors.
