# CS-153-Project
Spying on grasshoppers

locust_.py is the script that generates the augmented video along with detected orientation data for all 133 videos (had some trouble with data handling with the other videos and the 96 and 146 videos were excluded from the data since they were recorded at an angle).

In order for the script to run, the videos and data must be in the same folder.

After the script runs, a window should appear of the error over time. The script also prints out the net orientation and net axis errors.
