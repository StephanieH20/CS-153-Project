Spying on grasshoppers

locust_.py is the script that generates the augmented video along with detected orientation data for the sample videos (I had some trouble with data handling with the other videos). There is also a brief Jupyter notebook demo on how the detection process works.

In order for the script to run, the videos and data must be in the same folder.

After the script runs, a window should appear of the error over time. The script also prints out the net orientation and net axis errors.
